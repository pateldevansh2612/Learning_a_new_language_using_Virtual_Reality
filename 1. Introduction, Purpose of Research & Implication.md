# Learning_a_new_language_using_Virtual_Reality

Purpose of research
The scope of research in the area of learning through the use of virtual reality (VR) in terms of human-computer interaction (HCI) would involve investigating the impact of VR technology on learning outcomes, as well as understanding how to design effective VR-based learning experiences that maximize user engagement and learning.
With the advent of newer technologies, we want to explore the impact of new platforms in learning new concepts.

Research Questions:
1. Does the use of VR improve learning retention for learning a new language (Spanish)?
2. How well were participants able to grasp the language (Spanish) using the platform
(Mondly)?
