Method & Details about Data collection
● Within group study
● 8 people over 6 weeks
● Participants are young adults with college degrees

Begin study
● Step 1
Each participant would take the standardized test and their scores would be logged.

● Step 2
Each week there are lessons pre-determined in Mondly that each participant would take and at the end of each week there would be a quiz whose score would be logged. This is repeated over 6 weeks for all 8 participants; of the 6 weeks, each medium would be used for 3 weeks where the weeks are randomly assigned and balanced by a Latin-Square design as shown in figure below.

● Step 3
After the end of 6 weeks, each participant is required to take the standardized Spanish
proficiency test again as well as a post-test survey.

Hypotheses
● Alternative hypothesis
1. Using VR for learning will help an individual better learn a language.
2. Using Mondly will help participants learn the Spanish language.

● Null hypothesis
1. Using VR for learning will not help an individual better learn a language.
2. Using Mondly will not help participants learn the Spanish language.
